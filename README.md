This project was VERY HEAVILY inspired by <a className="link" href="https://dergigi.com" target="_blank">@gigi</a>'s <a className="link" href="https://www.fuckingshitcoins.com" target="_blank">fuckingshitcoins.com</a>, which is a VERY SERIOUS campaign to shame merchants into adopting bitcoin.
                    Since it feels like shaming merchants just wasn't enough, I decided to make it easier for plebs to shame on anyone who spends fiat on useless stuff :)
